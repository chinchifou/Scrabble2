# Limitations and bugs

## Limitations

### Dictionary and spelling

There is no dictionary to check the spelling. This means that misspellings will not be invalidated by the game.

### Scrabble rules and error prevention
If you do not follow the standard rules of Scrabble, the game will crash (for example: write diagonally, write two words at a time ...)


## Known Bugs

### Changing window resolution _(minor impact / random)_

1. When changing the window resolution of the game some artefacts may appear instead of black stripes arround the game. The current fix does not seems to work for low resolution or slow computer on windows 10.

2. On small resolutions the tiles on the board are not perfectly recovering the background.
