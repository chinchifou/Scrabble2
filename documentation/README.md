* Copy-paste the link to the desired location (on the desktop for instance).
* Right-click on it to open the properties menu.
* Change the values so that it correctly points to '/Scrabble2/sources/laucher/launcher.bat' (to be adapted depending of the installation folder of the game)
* Save the modifications.
* Double-click on it.

_You can also recreate your own Windows shortcut by using the icon stored in '/materials/images/icon'_
