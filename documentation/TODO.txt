__________  PRIMARY  __________


check TODO in code


Improve shuffle (for multiple letters before a blank spot) #TODO1


#TODO2 improve draw / draw all / use of layers ...


#TODO SIMPLIFY (separate stuff)

#TODO CREATE A FUNCTION

	layers.background.draw(window)
	layers.tiles.draw(window)
	layers.hand_holder.draw(window)
	layers.buttons.draw(window)
	var.background_no_letter = window.copy()

	layers.letters_on_board.draw(window)
	layers.letters_just_played.draw(window)
	
	var.current_player.hand.draw(window)

	var.current_background_no_text = window.copy()

	progress_bar.draw()
	ui_text.drawText()

	var.current_background = window.copy()


Possibility to redraw Letter

use save game

Clean code builder from github (especially for "/config")

Clean script to install needed librairies + check dependancies



__________  REFACTORING  __________

create redrawAll() function to update the screen ? 
def redrawAll()
	layer_background.draw()
	layer_letters.draw()
	...

+ drawFrom(nb_layer)

add a priority level for layer ?


declare as global vars:
window
language_id

create "update" for buttons to update state base on mouse cursor position



tile size 2 times smaller ??

create function for log ?

create a class Action() ?

possibility to save different games rules (board layout, letters in bag) ?



__________  SECONDARY  __________

Calculate Points Horizontal before verticaly when one letter played (easier to understand in Ui when multiple word)

allow to change display settings while game is running

Think of anonther display for "scrabble obtained"

UI - switch "scores" and "previous turn summary"

possibilility to change value for "points for a scrabble"

set logger to different levels from a file



__________  PERFORMANCE  __________

Separate the background into two parts to allow partial refresh of the content (board on the left and menu on the right)

find a better way to initialize game variables by using their real type ?



__________  BUG  __________

fix a glitch on LAPTOP or low resolutions (small black strip) for board when big window (bug already present in Scrabble V1) maybe due to to bad "round"
> use smaller tile size ?



__________  TO KEEP IN MIND  __________

/!\ warning for "PLAY_LETTER", the letter must not always go where the player release the click. More calculation to do use collidelistall()
/!\ warning for "PLAY_LETTER", when clicking on a button and releasing the clic above a letter

The event queue offers some simple filtering. This can help performance slightly by blocking certain event types from the queue, use the pygame.event.set_allowed() and pygame.event.set_blocked() to work with this filtering
