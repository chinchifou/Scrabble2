__________  PRIMARY  __________


check TODO in code


Special dev :

add avatar


Common dev :

	#TODO SIMPLIFY (separate stuff)
	#TODO CREATE A FUNCTION

	layers.background.draw(window)
	layers.tiles.draw(window)
	layers.hand_holder.draw(window)
	layers.buttons.draw(window)
	var.background_no_letter = window.copy()

	layers.letters_on_board.draw(window)
	layers.letters_just_played.draw(window)
	
	var.current_player.hand.draw(window)

	var.current_background_no_text = window.copy()

	progress_bar.draw()
	ui_text.drawText()

	var.current_background = window.copy()


Refactor calculatePoints()
	I. Not allowed if not close to an existing word
		if letter_on_board.size > 0
			there are already played letters closeby

	II. Not allowed in diagonal
		Played letters must followed a line

	III. First word must have more than one letter and be on the start tile
		If letter_on_board.size == 0
			letters_played.size should be > 1
			and
			for tile in letters played 
				some of tile must be on start tile

	IV. Create and hanlde events for invalid moves

	V. Display errors messages (even when multiple messages)


Possibility to redraw Letter

use save game

scripts for installation

add file for dependencies



__________  REFACTORING  __________

create redrawAll() function to update the screen ? 
def redrawAll()
	layer_background.draw()
	layer_letters.draw()
	...

declare as global vars:
window
language_id

create "update" for buttons to update state base on mouse cursor position

add a priority level for layer ?

tile size 2 times smaller ??

create function for log ?

create a class Action() ?

possibility to save different games rules (board layout, letters in bag) ?



__________  SECONDARY  __________

allow to change display settings while game is running

display error message on UI when invalid move

Think of anonther display for "scrabble obtained"

UI - switch "scores" and "previous turn summary"

possibilility to change value for "points for a scrabble"

set logger to different levels from a file



__________  PERFORMANCE  __________

Separate the background into two parts to allow partial refresh of the content (board on the left and menu on the right)

find a better way to initialize game variables by using their real type ?



__________  BUG  __________

fix a glitch on LAPTOP or low resolutions (small black strip) for board when big window (bug already present in Scrabble V1) maybe due to to bad "round"
> use smaller tile size ?



__________  TO KEEP IN MIND  __________

/!\ warning for "PLAY_LETTER", the letter must not always go where the player release the click. More calculation to do use collidelistall()
/!\ warning for "PLAY_LETTER", when clicking on a button and releasing the clic above a letter

The event queue offers some simple filtering. This can help performance slightly by blocking certain event types from the queue, use the pygame.event.set_allowed() and pygame.event.set_blocked() to work with this filtering
