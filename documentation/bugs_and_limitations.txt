DICTIONARY

CHANGING WNDOW RESOLUTION
1/
When changing the window resolution of the game some artefacts may appear instead of black stripes arround the game. The current fix does not seems to work for low resolution or slow computer on windows 10.
2/
On small resolutions the tiles on the board are not perfectly recovering the background.
