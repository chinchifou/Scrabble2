DICTIONARY
There is no dictionary to check the spelling. This means that misspellings will not be invalidated by the game.

RULES OF THE GAMES
If you do not follow the standard rules of Scrabble, the game will crash (for example: write diagonally, write two words at a time ...)

_________________ Known Bugs _________________

It seems impossible to run the game in full-screen mode on a secondary monitor. However, the windowed mode works correctly.
