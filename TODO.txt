	layer_letters.draw()
	...

BUG

fix a glitch on LAPTOP or low resolutions (small black strip) for board when big window (bug already present in Scrabble V1) maybe due to to bad "round"
> use smaller tile size ?


TO KEEP IN MIND

/!\ warning for "PLAY_LETTER", the letter must not always go where the player release the click. More calculation to do use collidelistall()
/!\ warning for "PLAY_LETTER", when clicking on a butioon and relaesing the clic above a letter



SECONDARY

create a variable for "points for a scrabble" + possibilility to change value

restrict length of player name

create a class Action()

create function for log ?

possibility to save different games rules (board layout, letters in bag)

create "update" for buttons to update state base on mouse cursor position

allow to change display settings while game is running

play music if "SCRABBLE"

The event queue offers some simple filtering. This can help performance slightly by blocking certain event types from the queue, use the pygame.event.set_allowed() and pygame.event.set_blocked() to work with this filtering



TO SEE 

add a priority level for layer ?

tile size 2 times smaller ??
