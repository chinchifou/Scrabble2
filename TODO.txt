pb of current_player.hand disapearing une fois sur deux

check TODO in code

Make the hand holder a sprite (for "PLAY_LETTER")


create a children class from Sprite with a method resize and common var ! (replace '*' with 'joker' for letters + widht and heightinstead of 'size')
see if pos_x is needed or if pos_x_in_tiles is_enought / same with width and height
normalize for board (name and position)

/!\ warning for "PLAY_LETTER", the letter must not always go where the player release the click. More calculation to do use collidelistall()

def draw all()
	layer_background.draw()
	layer_letters.draw()
	...

create a class Action()

create function for log ?

less highlighted buttons (2-3 pixel less pronounced)

Able to change the language of the UI -> text file for ui text in different languages

use save game

remove all updates functions 

play music if "SCRABBLE"

The event queue offers some simple filtering. This can help performance slightly by blocking certain event types from the queue, use the pygame.event.set_allowed() and pygame.event.set_blocked() to work with this filtering


TO SEE 

add a priority level for layer ?

tile size 2 times smaller ??
